Once you click "Start Game" you will be sent to a waiting room until another player joins the game.
The game starts with the first player choosing 1 out of 3 words that he would like to draw for the other person.
When a word is chosen, one player draws and in the meantime, the other player guesses the word.
Once a word is guessed correctly, the roles switch and the game starts over.
The game will go on until one of the players leaves by:
1.pressing the red X icon on the top left of the screen.
2.exiting the browser.
